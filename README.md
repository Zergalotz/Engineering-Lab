# Engineering-Lab: Systems & Automation Workshop

## Executive Summary
This repository serves as my **centralized laboratory** for mastering embedded systems, industrial automation, and the bridge between software logic and physical hardware. It documents my **90/10 transition** from high-level software engineering to field-ready systems integration. 

Rather than just a collection of code, this lab is a chronological record of how I apply software engineering rigor to physical electrical neighborhoods.

## Mission & Intentions
The core objective of this lab is to build a documented history of technical growth across three critical domains:

* **The Physical Neighborhoods:** Mastering power distribution, analog sensing, and digital actuation on the Arduino Uno platform.
* **System Reliability:** Moving from "hobbyist" sketches to professional, non-blocking, and fail-safe industrial code (C++ and PlatformIO).
* **The Software-Hardware Bridge:** Utilizing Python for data logging, telemetry visualization, and AI-assisted development to solve real-world problems.

## Lab Roadmap (Project Index)
This lab is organized by "Field Sessions." Each folder contains its own code, recordings, screen shots, photos, and a dedicated **Accordion-Style README** for deep dives. 

Note: wiring diagrams will be added upon completion and tested.

| Session | Title                                     | Key Learning Objective                      | Status             |
|---------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| **01**  | [Internal Blink](./01_Internal_Blink)     | Digital Neighborhood & Internal Clock Logic | ✅ Complete        |
| **02**  | [Analog Telemetry](./02_Analog_Telemetry) | ADC Mapping, Potentiometers, and LED Alarms | 🚧 In Progress     |
| **03**  | **Environmental Sensing**                 | I2C Protocol & Thermal Threshold Monitoring | 📅 Upcoming        |

## Technical Standards
All projects in this lab adhere to professional engineering standards:
* **Encapsulated Assets:** All diagrams and media are stored in local `/assets` folders to ensure documentation stays portable.
* **Optimized Git:** Utilizing `.gitignore` to maintain a clean, code-only remote presence (excluding build artifacts).
* **Professional Documentation:** Using the **Accordion Method** to provide high-level clarity for recruiters while maintaining technical depth for engineers.
